# 🐍 Learn Python from Zero with Aadit and ChatGPT

Welcome to my self-learning journey into Python, guided entirely by ChatGPT.  
This repository contains **chapter-wise PDF notes** that I’ve compiled to document my understanding and progress as I learn Python from scratch.

---

## 📚 Chapters Covered

1. [Intro to Python](notes/Chapter1_Intro_To_Python.pdf)  
2. [Flow Control](notes/Chapter2_Flow_Control_Notes.pdf)  
3. [Loops](notes/Chapter3_Python_Loops_Notes.pdf)  
4. [Collections](notes/Chapter4_Python_Collections_Notes.pdf)

Each PDF is structured with clear syntax, examples, notes on common errors, and best practices — all written in my own words with support from ChatGPT.

## 💡 Why I Created This Repo

- To track and reinforce my own learning  
- To demonstrate consistency and commitment  
- To create accessible, beginner-friendly reference material for others  
- To eventually expand this into a full Python crash course

## 🚀 What’s Next?

More chapters coming soon:
- Functions and Scope  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Error Handling  
- File I/O  
- Real-world projects (Calculator, Web Scraper, ML Apps)

Stay tuned, and feel free to **star** or **share** if you find this helpful.
